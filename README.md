# Flight-Cancellations-Prediction-Using-SVM-and-PySpark
This project aims to predict flight cancellations using machine learning techniques implemented in PySpark within a three-node Hadoop cluster. Leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM), the model analyzes millions of flight records to identify patterns leading to cancellations.
